It establishes a secure environment where access to sensitive data can be controlled, ensuring only authorized individuals have access.

### Logging and Session Management Modules

These modules secure the stability of user interactions with the application. They include features like logging, which records administrative actions, and session management, which maintains user sessions securely.

### Qualitative Risk Analysis Module

This module helps in the assessment of risk, taking into account factors such as probability, impact, urgency, and the risk owner. It ties into the central theme of the application by allowing for a more comprehensive and insightful analysis of risk.

### Risk Management Module

This module maintains a record of all risks, detailing their characteristics such as category, potential responses, risk cause and effect, identifier, and creator. This forms the heart of the application, providing the data necessary for understanding and managing the risks.
