# Business Analysis 

Our application is a comprehensive Django-based platform that specializes in user authentication, permissions, risk management, session control, and robust risk qualitative analysis.

## Addressing Specific Business Needs

### User Authentication and Permissions
Our application ensures secure user authentication through the `AuthUser`, `AuthGroup`, and `AuthPermission` models. Granular access rights are managed for each user depending on their role or group, offering optimized security.

### Session Management
The `DjangoSession` model provides reliable session control, promoting secure and personalized user interactions with the app.

### Risk Management and Qualitative Analysis
The application incorporates detailed risk management features. Using the `RiskManagementRisk` and `QualitativeRiskAnalysisQualitativeriskanalysis` models, the platform enables recording, tracking, and detailed qualitative analysis of risks. 

## Improving Existing Solutions

### Flexibility and Scalability
Thanks to Django's modular and reusable code structure, our application offers significant flexibility compared to other solutions. This facilitates easy scalability to adapt to expanding business needs.

### Tailored User Access
Our app goes beyond basic user roles to ensure highly specific user permissions, improving security by reducing unnecessary access.

### Integrated Risk Analysis
Many apps require separate platforms for risk management, but our application integrates this directly. This comprehensive approach not only improves efficiency but also enables real-time updates and tracking. 

### Risk Assessment Matrix and Trends
In addition to individual risk management, the application also generates a risk assessment matrix and visualizes risk trends. 

## Adaptability for Different Business Contexts
The modular design of Django makes this application highly adaptable across various business contexts.
