# Data Analysis

A crucial component of our risk management application is its ability to perform efficient data analysis, which is instrumental in making informed decisions and risk assessments. Here, we provide an overview of the data models used in our Django application and how they contribute to the project's data analysis component.

## Database Structure

Our Django-based risk management application incorporates a well-defined database structure, evident in the Django models provided in the code base.

```python
class RiskManagementRisk(models.Model):
    category = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    potential_responses = models.CharField(max_length=3)
    risk_cause = models.TextField()
    risk_effect = models.TextField()
    risk_id = models.CharField(unique=True, max_length=100)
    risk_identified_by = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField()
    risk_type = models.CharField(max_length=3)
    risk_name = models.ForeignKey('RiskManagementRiskname', models.DO_NOTHING)

    class Meta:
        managed = False
        db_table = 'risk_management_risk'
```

In the `RiskManagementRisk` model shown above, we store various details related to a risk, such as its category, potential responses, cause, effect, and more. This model represents the core of our risk management system.

## Data Analysis Methodology

Our Django application performs data analysis operations on the backend using the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system, which allows us to interact with our database, like you would with SQL. In other words, it's a way to create, retrieve, update, and delete records in your database using Python.

For instance, we use Django ORM to analyze the `RiskManagementRisk` data to identify patterns, trends, and draw insights.

```python
# Fetch all risks
risks = RiskManagementRisk.objects.all()

# Analyze the data: count risks by category
risks_by_category = risks.values('category').annotate(count=models.Count('category'))

# Analyze the data: find risks with the highest potential impact
high_impact_risks = risks.filter(potential_responses__gte=3)
```

We continue our data analysis across different models, allowing us to aggregate risk data and derive meaningful information that aids in risk assessment and decision-making.


The seamless integration of Django's ORM system with Python's data analysis libraries makes our risk management application a robust tool for interpreting risk data and facilitating data-driven decisions.
