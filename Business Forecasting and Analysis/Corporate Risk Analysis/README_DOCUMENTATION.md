# Django Risk Management System

The Django Risk Management System is a comprehensive application with a core purpose of providing a systematic approach to recognizing and addressing risks. This Django-based application manages user authentication, group permissions, session data, and carries out qualitative risk analysis on various risk parameters.

**User Authentication and Permission Management**

The system uses models such as `AuthUser`, `AuthGroup`, `AuthPermission`, `AuthUserGroups`, and `AuthUserUserPermissions` to manage user authentication and group permissions. These models enable management of user logins, grouping users, and assigning permissions to users or groups, indicating that the system uses user-based access controls. Only authenticated users can access certain resources, providing a secure environment.

**Logging and Session Management**

The models `DjangoAdminLog` and `DjangoSession` are crucial in handling logging of admin actions and managing user sessions respectively. These provide an efficient way to track administrative actions and user sessions within the system. 

**Content Management**

The `DjangoContentType` model manages types of content within the system while `DjangoMigrations` takes care of database schema changes as the application evolves over time, ensuring the smooth operation of the system despite data structure changes.

**Risk Management and Analysis**

The `RiskManagementRisk` and `RiskManagementRiskname` models are the core of the risk management feature. `RiskManagementRisk` stores risk data such as the potential responses, cause, effect, who identified the risk, and other related information. In parallel, `RiskManagementRiskname` seems to store the names and types of risks, aiding in categorization and identification.

In addition to risk management, the system also conducts qualitative risk analysis. The `QualitativeRiskAnalysisQualitativeriskanalysis` model stores the results of the qualitative risk analysis, including the risk's probability, impact, rating, owner, urgency, and the corresponding risk entry. 

By utilizing these features, users of the system can efficiently analyze each risk based on its attributes and context, providing a comprehensive understanding of the risk and facilitating informed decision-making.

In summary, the Django Risk Management System is a robust tool for risk management and analysis, providing the necessary features to input, manage, and analyze risks qualitatively. With built-in user management and session handling, it creates a secure platform suitable for multi-user risk management.
