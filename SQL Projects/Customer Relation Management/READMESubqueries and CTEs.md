# SQL Problem Solving with Subqueries and CTEs


This repository aims to solve a common SQL problem using two different methods, subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs). It focuses on the `SalesOrderHeader` table in the AdventureWorks2019 database.


## Problem Statement
The task involves extracting and comparing the total sales due for the top 10 sales orders for each month, ranked by order amount. Two methods are used to accomplish this: subqueries and CTEs. The final output should be a list of the total sales due for each month, including the total sales due from the previous month for a comparison.


## Objective
The objective of this project is to leverage SQL's flexibility to perform complex data manipulations using two different methods - subqueries and CTEs. This would provide insights on:


1. How to extract valuable information from a database using SQL.
2. Compare and contrast the effectiveness, readability, and efficiency of subqueries and CTEs.
3. The top 10 sales orders for each month based on the `TotalDue` amount and the trend observed from month to month.
4. Understand the role that subqueries and CTEs can play in enhancing code maintainability and performance tuning in SQL.


By executing and analyzing these codes, you can understand which sales months had a significant increase or decrease compared to the previous month. This information can help the business focus its marketing efforts more efficiently.
