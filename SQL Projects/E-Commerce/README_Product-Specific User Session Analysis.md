                                     ###Product-Specific User Session Analysis with SQL

**Description**: This SQL script provides a comprehensive analysis of user sessions related to two specific products, '/the-original-mr-fuzzy' and '/the-forever-love-bear'. It aims to understand user engagement by tracking their journey from visiting product pages to potentially completing a purchase.

The analysis proceeds in four distinct steps:

**Step 1: User Session Selection and Product Page Identification**: In the first step, the script filters out all user sessions that included visits to either of the two product pages on a specific date. A temporary table, 'landingpage', is created to store these user sessions along with their associated product page.

**Step 2: Counting Sessions for Each Product**: The script then counts the total number of sessions for each product, providing insights into which product is garnering more user attention and engagement.

**Step 3: Subsequent Page Visit Analysis**: Next, for each session, the script calculates the total number of sessions for all the pages visited post visiting the product page. This gives a sense of user behaviour and their interest in proceeding with further steps of the purchase process.

**Step 4: Product-Centric Funnel Calculation**: In the final step, the script calculates the conversion funnel for each subsequent page, relative to the main product pages. This funnel calculation does not depend on the sequence of page visits within the session. This provides us with an understanding of the conversion rate for each stage of the purchasing process, independent of the previous page visited.

By closely examining user interactions with the product pages and subsequent pages, this script can inform product marketing strategies, help identify possible improvements in user flow, and contribute to overall website optimization efforts.
