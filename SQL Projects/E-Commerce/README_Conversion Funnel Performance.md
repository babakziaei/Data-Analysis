## "In-depth Analysis of Conversion Funnel Efficacy using SQL Workflow"

Overview: This code provides an exhaustive examination of our website's conversion funnel's efficacy by tracking the user journey from their initial arrival on the page to the completion of an order. The objective is to gather insights about user behaviour at every funnel stage, pinpoint potential bottlenecks, and identify areas that could benefit from improvement.

The process is structured into four consecutive stages:

### Step 1: Session Selection and Pageviews Retrieval: This segment of the code selects all the pageviews related to sessions that fulfill specific criteria. Specifically, those sessions that occurred between August 5, 2012, and September 5, 2012, originating from non-branded Google searches.

### Step 2: Funnel Step Classification: Each pageview is categorized based on its location in the conversion funnel, from the landing page through to the 'Thank You' page displayed post-order completion.

### Step 3: Session-Level Conversion Funnel Generation: A temporary table is generated to store the furthest stage each session reached in the funnel. This action condenses page-level data into a more compact, session-level perspective, thus facilitating further analysis.

### Step 4: Funnel Performance Assessment: The concluding stage includes summarizing the session-level data to extract funnel performance metrics. This encompasses the count of sessions reaching each stage and the click-through rate from one stage to the succeeding one.

By methodically deconstructing the conversion process, this code provides a comprehensive understanding of user behaviour at every stage of the conversion funnel. These insights can guide us in optimizing our website design and enhancing the overall user experience.
