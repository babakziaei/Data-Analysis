                                     "Conversion Funnel Performance Analysis via SQL Pipeline"

Description: This script meticulously analyzes the effectiveness of our website's conversion funnel by following the user journey from landing on the initial page through to order completion. It aims to provide insights into user behavior at each stage of the conversion funnel, identify potential bottlenecks, and suggest areas for improvement.

The analysis unfolds in four sequential steps:

Step 1: Session Selection and Pageviews Retrieval: This part of the script selects all pageviews associated with sessions that meet certain criteria, specifically those generated between August 5, 2012, and September 5, 2012, originated from non-branded Google searches.

Step 2: Funnel Step Identification: Each pageview is classified according to its position in the conversion funnel, from the landing page through to the 'Thank You' page that appears after an order is placed.

Step 3: Session-Level Conversion Funnel Construction: A temporary table is created to store the maximum stage of the funnel each session reached. This transforms page-level data into a more condensed, session-level view, facilitating subsequent analysis.

Step 4: Funnel Performance Evaluation: The final step involves summarizing the session-level data to derive funnel performance metrics. This includes the number of sessions reaching each stage and the click-through rate from each stage to the next.

By breaking down the conversion process in such detail, this script provides comprehensive insights into user behavior at each stage of the conversion funnel. These insights can guide us in optimizing our website design and improving overall user experience.
