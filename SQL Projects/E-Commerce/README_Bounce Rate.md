         "Bounce Rate Analysis: Comparative Analysis of Landing Page Performance in a 50/50 Traffic Distribution Scenario"

This SQL script is designed to analyze the performance of landing pages ('/home' and 'lander-1') under a 50/50 traffic distribution scenario for a specified time period. The process is split into four distinct steps:

Step 1: Identifies the first website_pageview_id for the sessions that meet our criteria (those created before '2012-07-28', with a website_pageview_id larger than 23504, and coming from a specific campaign on Google Search). This information is stored in a temporary table named first_pageviews_demo.

Step 2: Using the data collected in the previous step, it associates each session with its respective landing page. This association is done by matching the minimum website_pageview_id found previously with the website_pageview_id from the website_pageviews table. The resulting data is saved in a new temporary table called session_w_landing_page_demo.

Step 3: This step identifies 'bounce' sessions, which are sessions where only one page is viewed. It uses the data from session_w_landing_page_demo and website_pageviews tables to count the number of pages viewed in each session. Sessions where only one page was viewed are considered 'bounces' and this information is stored in a new temporary table, bounced_sessions_only.

Step 4: The final step aggregates the data to calculate the total number of sessions and bounced sessions for each landing page. The script calculates a 'bounce rate' by dividing the number of bounced sessions by the total number of sessions for each landing page. The results are displayed for further analysis.

This script heavily relies on the GROUP BY clause and temporary tables for its multi-step analytical process. The conclusions drawn from this data can help understand the effectiveness of different landing pages in terms of user engagement and retention.
