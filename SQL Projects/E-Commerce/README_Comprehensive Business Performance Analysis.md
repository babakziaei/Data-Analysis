# Description
This readme details the analysis of a wide array of metrics to understand the growth trajectory, operational efficiency, and future opportunities for an online retail business. The SQL queries cover several key performance indicators including overall session and order volume, session-to-order conversion rates, revenue per order, and revenue per session. The analysis also dives deep into channel-specific order volumes and conversion rates, trends in revenue and margins by product, and the impact of new products on overall sales and conversions. Finally, it concludes with a perspective on future growth opportunities based on the insights gathered.

Certainly, here's a more elaborate description:

# Detailed Steps:

1. **Volume Growth**: The starting point of any business analysis is understanding the overall growth trends. In this step, we analyze the growth of the business in terms of session and order volume, by each quarter. This gives us a broad understanding of the rate of growth and also helps identify any key time periods that stand out. The analysis also takes into account that the data for the most recent quarter might be incomplete, and handles it appropriately.

2. **Efficiency Improvements**: This step revolves around how effectively the business is converting its website sessions into orders, and how much revenue it's generating per order and per session. Here, we showcase these key performance metrics for each quarter since the business's launch. This helps in understanding the overall operational efficiency of the business and its improvements over time.

3. **Channel Growth**: Understanding the source of orders is crucial for any online business. This step involves a deep dive into different marketing channels like Gsearch nonbrand, Bsearch nonbrand, brand search overall, organic search, and direct type-in. We pull a quarterly view of orders from these channels to understand their individual and comparative performance.

4. **Conversion Rate Trends**: Building on the previous step, we then look into the conversion rate trends for these same channels. The goal is to understand how effectively each channel converts website sessions into orders. We examine these trends quarter by quarter and highlight any periods where the business made significant improvements or optimizations.

5. **Product-wise Revenue Trends**: In this step, we shift our focus to product-specific performance. We pull data showing monthly revenue and margin trends for each product, along with total sales and revenue. This helps us understand how each product is contributing to the business and to spot any patterns of seasonality in product performance.

6. **Impact of New Products**: The introduction of new products can have significant effects on the overall performance of a business. In this step, we examine the impact of new product introductions on website session behavior and conversions. This involves analyzing the sessions on the /products page, how many of these sessions lead to a clickthrough to another page, and how the conversion from /products to placing an order has improved over time.

7. **Cross-sell Analysis**: Cross-selling is an important sales strategy that can significantly boost revenue. Following the introduction of the 4th product as a primary product on December 05, 2014, we pull sales data to understand the cross-selling dynamics between the products. This step uncovers how well each product is being cross-sold alongside the others.

8. **Future Recommendations and Opportunities**: Finally, based on all the insights and trends we've uncovered in the previous steps, we share recommendations and potential opportunities for the future. This step allows us to think strategically about the next steps for the business. We might uncover potential channels to invest more in, products that might benefit from further promotion, or new strategies for product cross-selling.

Remember, the goal of this analysis is not only to provide a snapshot of the current performance of the business but also to inform future strategies. Therefore, we encourage a continual process of analysis, strategy development, and testing to keep the business evolving based on the data-driven insights.
