# In-depth Business Performance Evaluation Utilizing SQL

## Introduction:

This document delineates the process of analyzing a multitude of metrics to comprehend the growth trajectory, operational efficiency, and potential opportunities for an online retail enterprise. The SQL inquiries encompass numerous key performance indicators, such as total session and order volume, session-to-order conversion rates, revenue per order and per session. Furthermore, the investigation scrutinizes channel-specific order volumes and conversion rates, trends in revenue and margins per product, and the influence of new products on overall sales and conversions. Lastly, it encapsulates the insights obtained to shed light on prospective growth opportunities.

## Elaborate Process Breakdown:

1. **Volume Growth**: The foundation of any business investigation is the comprehension of overarching growth trends. This initial phase evaluates the business's growth in terms of session and order volume on a quarterly basis, offering a comprehensive understanding of the growth rate and highlighting any distinctive time periods. The most recent quarter's data, which might be incomplete, is appropriately handled.

2. **Efficiency Improvements**: This phase is centered around assessing the business's efficiency in converting its website sessions into orders, and the amount of revenue generated per order and per session. This step provides a visualization of these pivotal performance metrics on a quarterly basis since the business's initiation, aiding in grasping the overall operational efficiency of the business and its evolution over time.

3. **Channel Growth**: Ascertaining the origin of orders is paramount for any online enterprise. This stage involves an in-depth examination of different marketing channels, such as Gsearch nonbrand, Bsearch nonbrand, overall brand search, organic search, and direct type-in. A quarterly view of orders from these channels is drawn up to understand their individual and comparative performance.

4. **Conversion Rate Trends**: Building upon the previous step, we then probe into the conversion rate trends for these same channels. The objective is to understand how efficiently each channel is transforming website sessions into orders. We scrutinize these trends quarter by quarter, underscoring any periods where the business has achieved notable enhancements or optimizations.

5. **Product-wise Revenue Trends**: Here, the focus is shifted to the performance of individual products. Data representing monthly revenue and margin trends for each product, coupled with total sales and revenue, is retrieved. This helps in understanding each product's contribution to the business and in identifying any signs of seasonality in product performance.

6. **Impact of New Products**: The launch of new products can significantly influence a business's overall performance. This stage examines the effects of new product introductions on website session behavior and conversions, involving an analysis of the sessions on the /products page, the number of these sessions that resulted in a clickthrough to another page, and how the conversion from /products to order placement has evolved over time.

7. **Cross-sell Analysis**: Cross-selling, an important sales strategy, can considerably augment revenue. Following the launch of the 4th product as a primary product on December 05, 2014, sales data is pulled to understand the dynamics of cross-selling between the products. This phase uncovers how effectively each product is being cross-sold with the others.

8. **Future Recommendations and Opportunities**: Based on all the insights and trends unearthed in the previous stages, we propose recommendations and prospective opportunities for the future. This step enables strategic thinking about the business's next moves, potentially identifying channels worth further investment, products that could benefit from additional promotion, or novel strategies for product cross-selling.

The aim of this analysis extends beyond merely offering a snapshot of the business's current performance; it also seeks to inform future strategies. As such, an ongoing cycle of analysis, strategy development, and testing is recommended to ensure the business evolves based on data-driven insights.
